        I am a podcast producer living in Brooklyn, NY. I am interested in histories of science and technology, experimental audio narratives, and oddball theories of all sorts.

      <a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/podcasts/whats-your-problem" target="_blank"><b>What's Your Problem?</b></a><br>
I produce this weekly show from Pushkin Industries, hosted by Jacob Goldstein. We talk to entrepreneurs and engineers about the future they want to see, the projects they're working on, and the problems they need to solve to get there.

        <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sferics/id1726826331" target="_blank"><b>Sferics</b></a><br> An outlet for my ongoing experiments in audio storytelling. Sferics &#40;radio atmospheric signals&#41; are bursts of radio waves created by lightning. Meaningless static or flashes of inspiration.
